# BloodAutomation-with-CSharp

This is my first project I used database. I coded the basic real blood bank automation with C#. I tried to use clean code techniques.

<b>First you have to connect your own Microsoft SQL. You can find this code in ‘Function.cs’</b>

We are creating our project’s database tables. We’ll use this information in our quaries later.
This table gives us donor information.

This is second table about blood stocks. This table give us blood informations. After creating our tables, we insert informations. <br> This is manual way.
